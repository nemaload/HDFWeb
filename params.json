{"name":"HDFWeb","tagline":"A browser-based HDF5 image viewer","body":"[![Nemaload Logo](http://nemaload.davidad.org/png/nemaload)](http://nemaload.davidad.org)\r\n_presents_\r\n#Nemashow\r\nNemashow is a web application which will enable the public to access interactive visualizations of data produced by the [NEMALOAD](http://nemaload.davidad.org) project. Nemashow is built on the [Meteor](http://meteor.com/) framework, and uses [WebGL](http://webgl.org) for visualizations.\r\n\r\n##Setup\r\n###Dependencies\r\nAside from Meteor itself (`$ curl https://install.meteor.com | sh`) and a WebGL-capable browser (we use the latest [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) builds; you can test your browser [here](http://www.doesmybrowsersupportwebgl.com/)), you'll also need:\r\n* [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite): `$ npm install -g meteorite`\r\n* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) command-line tools\r\n\r\n###Data\r\nThe application expects to find data in `meteor/data` (absent from this repository). The actual dataset is many gigabytes; while we are currently working to make it publicly available, for now just contact us if you're interested.\r\n\r\n###Usage\r\nTo run the website, run the `mtr` command from the `meteor` directory and point your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.\r\nTo access lightsheet images data, you also need to run the `./simple-hdf-server.py ../data` command, where `../data` is the directory holding HDF5 lightsheet data files.\r\nTo access lightsheet bounding box plotting functionality, also run the `./computation-server.py ../data` command.\r\n\r\n###Administration\r\nTo make a user an administrator, direct database access is required. In the `db.users` collection, simply set a user's `admin` field to `\"admin\"`.\r\n\r\n##Roadmap\r\nNemashow's support for light-field visualizations is nearly complete. Our goals for the short term include integrating light-sheet visualizations, improving reusability of workflow utilities, and making the application scalable for public deployment. \r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
