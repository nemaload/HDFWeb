{"name":"NEMASHOW","tagline":"A browser-based HDF5 image viewer","body":"[![Nemaload Logo](http://nemaload.davidad.org/png/nemaload)](http://nemaload.davidad.org)\r\n#NEMASHOW\r\nNEMASHOW is a web application which enables the public to access interactive visualizations of data produced by the [NEMALOAD](http://nemaload.davidad.org) project. Nemashow is built on the [Meteor](http://meteor.com/) framework, and uses [WebGL](http://webgl.org) for visualizations.\r\n\r\n##Datasets\r\nNEMASHOW allows you to explore snapshots and videos capturing c. elegans specimen on microscopic scale. But 2D images are not enough for us - we are looking for ways to achieve a 3D capture of the worm's neuronal activity. We offer two kinds of data - \"light field\" data that uses clever optics to capture the worm's body from multiple angles simultaneously and \"light field\" data (still experimental) that uses laser scanning to capture a fully 3D model.\r\n\r\nFor the light field data, we also already offer some very simple data visualization. This is still a work in progress though, so please consider the visualized data (neuron positions etc.) as just a demo.\r\n\r\n##Technical Setup\r\n###Overview\r\nThe process of getting a working copy of NEMASHOW can be grouped into several broad steps:\r\n\t\r\n1. Ensuring your setup meets the necessary requirements and has the necessary dependencies\r\n2. Downloading the repositories and, optionally, the project dataset\r\n3. Running setup scripts\r\n\r\n###Requirements\r\n####Browser\r\nA WebGL capable browser is necessary to view the visualizations(we use the latest [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) builds; you can test your browser [here](http://www.doesmybrowsersupportwebgl.com/).) Support for other browsers is not guaranteed.\r\n\r\n####Operating System\r\n#####Running NEMASHOW\r\nIn production, NEMASHOW runs on servers running Ubuntu 13.04. However, development takes place on other Linux distributions, as well as Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n#####Viewing NEMASHOW\r\nUsually, if a WebGL capable browser can be successfully installed and tested, NEMASHOW will work.\r\n\r\nOne notable exception is light-sheet visualizations with the prerelease version of Mac OSX 10.9, due to a strange bug involving Cross Origin Resource Sharing. However, this OS version can be used when the light-sheet images and web app are hosted on the same server.\r\n\r\n####Storage Space\r\nIf you'd like to store the raw dataset, ~30GB of space is necessary. To store the PNG renderings of the files, ~7GB is necessary. \r\n\r\n###Dependencies\r\n####Meteor\r\nThe easiest way to install [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) is to run the command `$ curl https://install.meteor.com | sh` on a [supported platform.](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Supported-Platforms)\r\n\r\n####Meteorite\r\nWe use several Meteorite packages in the NEMASHOW application. This package is best installed with [npm](http://nodejs.org/download/) using the command `npm install -g meteorite`.\r\n\r\n####MongoDB\r\nThe [MongoDB command line tools](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) are necessary to run some setup scripts.\r\n\r\n####Python Libraries\r\nIf you choose to run the HDF server or computation server, several Python libraries are required as well as their various dependencies, including:\r\n\r\n* Tables\r\n* MatplotLib\r\n* SciPy\r\n\r\n\r\n###Data\r\n####Database\r\nMeteor will automatically generate the necessary collections the first time it runs. However, to import the information about our dataset, you can use the [monogorestore](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/) command on the database dump in `/meteor/dump/`.\r\n\r\n####Dataset\r\nThe application expects to find data in `meteor/data` (absent from this repository). The actual dataset is many gigabytes; please contact us if you'd like a copy.\r\n\r\n###Usage\r\n\r\nTo run the website, run the `mrt` command from the `meteor` directory and point your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.\r\nTo access lightsheet images data, you also need to run the `./simple-hdf-server.py ../data` command, where `../data` is the directory holding HDF5 lightsheet data files.\r\nTo access lightsheet bounding box plotting functionality, also run the `./computation-server.py ../data` command.\r\n\r\n###Administration\r\nTo make a user an administrator, direct database access is required. In the `db.users` collection, simply set a user's `admin` field to `\"admin\"`.\r\n\r\n##Roadmap\r\nNEMASHOW will continue to grow as the project does. As the project continues in its analysis of and signal extraction from the datasets, additional features will be added to the visualization to reflect this progress.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
